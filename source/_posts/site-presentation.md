Hello, my name is Vincenzo Pellegrini, and this is my blog.
On this site I'll release extensive guides on web development, from the frontend to the backend matter, while releasing updates on the development of the blog itself.

# Current configuration

Currently while this site is pretty simple, it's powered by really powerful frameworks, giving me a future-proof platform, that I can extend later.

## The generator

At this point in time, most of the work is done by [hexo.js](https://hexo.io/), a node js framework for building blogs. It's main feature is being a static site generator, meaning that while the end result is static and fast to serve, the pages are generated using templates, making it simple to make a change to the entire site's look and feel.
The articles are written manually in markdown files, but you can use some extensions to work with a more interactive interfate, if it's your thing.
 While making your own template is really easy (It's in my roadmap), there are plenty of community developed templates avaible online.
Currenty I'm using Apollo, a really nice and clean responsive template from China.

## The host

Currently this all site is hosted for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), because by far it is the best option i've found to host node js based projects. It features all the features you need from a modern static hosting solution, plus the special addition of being able to deploy from anywhere, because it's doing the compiling on the fly in the cloud.

## Source code

This site's source code is avaible on github, for anyone interested. It will alwais be the latest because nelify essentially gets the source to compile from there.

# Future Posts

In this first posts expect to see guides and updates on further functionalities of this blog, always using open source software, probably based on node.js.
